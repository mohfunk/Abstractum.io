# We Are But Reformers
###### إِنَّمَا نَحْنُ مُصْلِحُونَ 
As a child, I dreamt of a world-leading Saudi Arabia that kept me optimistic when all around me pointed to our incompetence.
I assured myself:  "when I grow up, I will rebuild my country." I genuinely wanted my people to flourish.
We only had Wahhabi clerks to idolize, those failed to speak to me; in fact, they only preached of death, fire, and torture. 
As a child, I pictured snakes wrapped around my dead body beneath the dirt in my grave. 
That was not exclusive to me, millions of Saudis lived it, but I decided I
deserve better.
Indeed, I Left Saudi to study in Canada; nevertheless, I belong to my people, and to
them I had every intention to return.     


I rarely followed news; and I never had any politcal views or ideologies, until
I heared about the young prince who spoke of my childhood dreams, I designed a
"Neo Jeddah" in highschool, and he is building Neom. Surely, here, a leader to
believe in. This very prince, criticized Wahhabism in a clear
language, seperating it from Islam. That was a godsend, I wanted to be part of
this.. not for too long, I regret.    


the foreign minister of
Canada tweeted to destroy me. I was furious, and I clearly expressed that; only to see
I was not allowed to express. My father turned against me, my friends were bothered by me, and I merely needed assurance.
I asked, a lot refused to talk, others attacked me, and many criminalized me.
When I turned to the media, I saw ignorance and false claims about people I
loved. The Saudi Media failed to speak to us, and continued to lie about Canada; had they showed empathy I would've be in Saudi.
I then came across a mini celebrity who
threatened us, who promised us severe punishment, the prince will kidnap us, will torture and silence us like he did with many before us.
He was roaming free, he was celebrated. I felt personally terrorized, dehumanized and I feared my country.

I thought it's going to be easy, but I was feeling guilty..
The ambitious creative Saudis who could use a programmer, the college students
who could use my help, the high school students whom I can convince to study
Computer Science were in my thoughts.
What about those? I belong with them, and I want to be with them, there is a lot
of work for me to do in Saudi and I was willing to do it, yet... who is going to
protect me from the radicals we see on social media? they killed jamal, and they
would do anything to be the heros.


Why is the saudi government allowing this to happen?
They are writers, government officals, and media figures...
they call everyone a traitor. Jamal died, and some writers are still calling him
a traitor. Is disagreement a treason?
