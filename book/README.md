# We Are But Reformers
###### إِنَّمَا نَحْنُ مُصْلِحُونَ 
As a child, I dreamt of a world-leading Saudi Arabia that kept me optimistic when all around me pointed to our incompetence.
I assured myself:  "when I grow up, I will rebuild my country." I genuinely wanted my people to flourish.
We only had Wahhabi clerks to idolize, those failed to speak to me; in fact, they only preached of death, fire, and torture. 
As a child, I pictured snakes wrapped around my dead body beneath the dirt in my grave. 
That was not exclusive to me, millions of Saudis lived it, but I decided I
deserve better.
Indeed, I Left Saudi to study in Canada; nevertheless, I belong to my people, and to
them I had every intention to return.     


I rarely followed news; and I never had any politcal views or ideologies, until
I heared about the young prince who spoke of my childhood dreams, I designed a
"Neo Jeddah" in highschool, and he is building Neom. Surely, here, a leader to
believe in. This very prince, criticized Wahhabism in a clear
language, seperating it from Islam. That was a godsend, I wanted to be part of
this.. not for too long, I regret.
