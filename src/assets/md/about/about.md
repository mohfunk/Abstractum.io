Though temporarily off school for reasons beyond my control, i'm still pursuing
a Bachelor's degree at the University of Waterloo's Math Faculty.

I have been making video games casually since the age of 11, and profissionally since mid 2017 under *Abstractum* (hence the domain) which was dissolved when I partnered with
with [Nasir Al-otabi.](https://twitter.com/NotNasser) to co-found **Monupon,** We're currently developing Wild Thieves, a Robbery Action Game, coming 2019.   

I am a huge Issac Newton's fanboy.
