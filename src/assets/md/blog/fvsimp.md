# Functional vs. Imperative Programming.
#### Nov 2018, 2 mins read. 
A powerful language must provide the following 3 mechanisms to allow the formulation of complex ideas from simpler ones:

- Primative Expressions: Entites the Language is concerned about.
- Means of Combinations: To form Compound Elements by combining simpler ones.
- Means of Abstractions: To manipulate compound elements as seperate units.

## Functional Programming
Functional programming is based on the following basic ideas:

- Evaluation of Expression.
- Binding Variables to Values.

The purpose of an Expression is to produce a Value, multiple related Expressions are grouped in a function.
A Mathematical function is a process (or mapping) that associates elements of one set to another, 
such that each element in the domain is associated with exactly one element in the range.   
**The order of evaluations does not matter.**

## Imperative Programming
Imperative programming is on the following ideas:

- Execution of Statements.
- Store of States

The purpose of a Statement is to alter the State of a variable in the Store of a program.
A Statement may depends on the previous State of a Variable in order to alter it.   
**The order of execution does matter.**
