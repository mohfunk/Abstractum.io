# We Are But Reformers
####إِنَّمَا نَحْنُ مُصْلِحُونَ



As a child, I dreamt of a world-leading Saudi Arabia, one that kept me optimistic when all around me pointed to our incompetence. I assured myself: "when I grow up, I will rebuild my country." I genuinely wanted my people to flourish. We only had Wahhabi clerks to idolize, those failed to speak to me; in fact, they preached of death, fire, and torture. As a child, I pictured snakes wrapped around my dead body beneath the dirt of my grave. That was not exclusive to me, millions of Saudis lived it. I, however, decided to leave and Indeed, I Left Saudi to study in Canada. Nevertheless, I belong to my people, and to them, I had every intention to return.     



I rarely followed news; and I never had any political views or ideologies to subscribe to, until I heard about the young prince who spoke of my childhood dreams, I designed a "Neo Jeddah" in high school, and he is building Neom. Surely, here, a leader to believe in. This very prince, criticized Wahhabism in a clear language, separating it from Islam. It was a godsend; I aspired to contribute to his reforms, not for long, I regret.
