# Play
### Definitions
I have always been frustrated with how Play is naively defined; for
instance, a google search yields the following:   
*Noun, Play:* Activity engaged in for **enjoyment and recreation**, especially by children.   

Animals of all kinds seem to engage in play; even dinosaurs, the deadly, cold-blooded reptiles, 
had a playful side! It is not merely an activity for *enjoyment* or *recreation.*
Many of the ideas I discuss here are adopted from the Dutch thinker and historian Johann Huizinga.
I subscribe to his school of thought as an appreciator of Play,
and as a student of its craft.   

### Man And Animal
We are the only species of the genus homo left; thus, we're inclined to assume
that we're an exception. Without a doubt, Man is the most powerful animal on the
planet; however, our dominance is newly acquired.   

For millions of years, Man roamed the earth as a mammal of no significance; human infants were born prematurely, helpless, and fully dependent
on their elders. Consequently, raising children was a task beyond the abilities of lone mothers; family members collaborated and socialized
for raising their offspring. It is without a doubt how we developed
our most potent weapon: Language.   
Nevertheless, We still procreate in a similar (if not identical) fashion to other mammals; we feed, protect, and care 
for our young with the same passion and aggressiveness; we hunt, build homes to take shelter, communicate, survive as other animals do.   

However, man is a sophisticated animal; we advanced beyond the sphere of primal animal life.
To socialize, we constructed societies and civilizations. From our instinct to procreate, 
we developed social constructs, rules, and countless methods of engagement. Our need to suppress hunger inclined us to 
develop rich cuisines. We may use tools and invent technologies to aid us in satisfying our basic instincts, 
but those drives, in their essence, are not unique to us;
our technologies and tools do not add a feature or alter their very essence.    


### Man And Play
All mammals play; in fact, Play is older than culture for culture presupposes human society. 
Describing Play is as a recreational activity that children engage in for fun or enjoyment is not different from describing 
sex as an activity that adults engage in for orgasm. Evolution enforces behaviours that are essential to survival;
there’s pleasure in consuming water, in satisfying hunger, and in having sex. There’s a great feeling of 
satisfaction and a sense of accomplishment that mothers experience while taking care of their children. This is an
instinct of great significance, perhaps beyond our understanding. It is part of life, for without it,
species won't survive or prosper.   

Play is another instinct that has a significant function that we cannot find a biological basis for.
It seems to be an integral part of animal life; yet, if we play for fun, then we drink water for 
pleasure. Please, do not content yourself with such shallow conclusions.   

### Why Play?
The historian Johan Huizinga has asserted that human civilization added no essential
feature to the general idea of play, animals of all kinds did not wait for man to teach them their playing.
Dinosaurs roamed the earth millions of years before our ancestors, and yet, they seemed to have played. 
Furthermore, Play is not derived from a purely biological or a physical need; it is not a physiological 
phenomenon or a psychological reflex, even in its simplest of forms. Many psychologists and scientists 
hypothesized biological functions that play serves; there were numerous attempts to discover 
such function, some of which include:   
- Play is a result of a need for "relaxation."
- Play is a discharge of abundant vital energy.
- Play is a method that trains young animals for serious life situation.
- Play is a “wish-fulfillment” activity.
- Play is an activity that satisfies the natural need for dominance and competition in a non-harmful environment.


All of these hypotheses share four common flaws:   
- They are narrow; failing to be inclusive of kinds of Play.
- They start with the assumption that play must serve a biological function.
- Play is considered without its profoundly aesthetic properties.
- Play is thought of as a rational activity.   


One can effortlessly deduce that all of these hypotheses vary; 
one hypothesis explains a given instance of play, but fail to
justify another; rendering its postulated nature to remain as such.
If we continue to think of play without its essential properties or start with an invalid assumption,
we continue to stay in the dark. 
Finally, one cannot assume that Play is a rational activity; for
otherwise, only humans Played. It extends beyond the sphere of human
life, and thus, its foundation cannot be discovered in a rational nexus. Animals are not merely mechanical; so they play.
Man is not rational; for Play is irrational.
It is easier to accept one of these hypotheses; however, one must content themselves with a limited, and a partial answer. 
I am not worried and neither should you, for contentment has never been and won't be a long-lasting state for man.
According to Johan Huizinga, a theory that describes the function of
play must render all the previous hypotheses obsolete, or unify them
as a coherent whole.   

I can assure you the following my dear reader: Everyone you know plays in one way or form, 
 despite their age, despite their seriousness.
 It’s challenging to define play, but it’s not difficult to differentiate it from what it’s not:
 Play is not the opposite of seriousness, it is not for children, Play is not rudimentary, senseless, artificial, pretentious or man-made.   


### We Are *Homo Ludens*
The 18th century and its age of *Enlightenment* ignited 
Anti-clericalism and the worship of reason. The great advances of the 16th and 17th centuries in science 
and human thought blinded so many. We boldly or perhaps naively, decided to name our species *Homo sapiens,* Man the Rational.
Thinkers refuted Sapiens as a name for our species, for we are not worthy of it.   
The complex nature of our brains gave us the ability to reason; this ability, however, is not in our essence.
Irrationality surrounds us, those who obsrve and reason are the outliers.

We inclined to designate our species as *Homo Faber,* Man the
Maker. Although; not as misleading as Sapiens, it is certainly not
an appropriate name for our kind, for man is a ruthless
destroyer as well. Furthermore, the use of *Homo Faber* suggests "the alienation from and objectification of nature." 
as the Italian philosopher Umberto Eco argued.
Johan Huizinga suggested *Homo ludens,* Man, the Player.
Linguistically however, the Latin word Ludens is more involved than simply *Play.*

### Other Names for Our Species
- *Homo Adorans:* Man The Worshiper, too narrow.
- *Homo Amans:* Man The Lover, too optimistic.
- *Homo Avers:* Man The Greedy, too sadistic.
- *Homo Combinans:* The Counting Man, perhaphs the most suitable name for our
    kind. We counted passed infinity.
