        <h1>Play</h1>
            <h3>Definitions</h3>
            <p>I have always been frustrated with how Play is naively defined; for
            instance, this is how Google Defines it: </p>
            <p></p>
            <p class="cen qu"><q><i>Noun</i>: Play. Activity engaged in for enjoyment and recreation, especially by
                    children.</q></p>
            <p>Play, in all its forms, is essential to us. Mammals and other animals seem to engage 
            in play; even dinosaurs, the deadly, cold-blooded reptiles, 
            had a playful side! Play comes in various forms; every kind of sport is a Play 
            activity, every kind of game, puzzle, and toy are forms of play. It
            is not merely an activity for <i>"enjoyment"</i> or <i>"recreation,"
                and it is absolutely not exclusive to children.</i> </p>
            <p>
            Many of the ideas, philosophies, and facts mentioned here are not
            purely mine. I merely adopted them as an appreciator of Play,
            and as a student of its craft. This school of thought was
            established and developed by the Dutch thinker and historian Johann Huizinga 
            in his book Homo Ludens.
            </p>
            <h3>Man And Animal</h3>
            <p>
            We tend to believe we are an exception; divine and fundamentally different 
            from other animals. We are the only members of the genus homo left; 
            we are, without a doubt, the most powerful animal on the planet. However, 
            all evidence seems to suggest we are the outcome of the long process of Evolution. Our dominance is newly acquired. 
            </p>
            <p>
            A million years ago, members of the genus homo were insignificant mammals; giving birth was difficult since the female 
            birth canal is not wide enough to fit a developed human brain. Thus,
            human babies were born prematurely, completely 
            helpless and dependent on their parents. Consequently, Females had to spend more time taking care of their infants, and males had to 
            support them, which made our species more social and perhaps it's how we developed
            our most potent weapon: Language.
            </p>
            <p>
            We still share many instincts with other mammals: We procreate in a similar (if not identical) fashion; we feed, protect, and care 
            for our young with the same passion and aggressiveness; we hunt, build homes to take shelter, communicate, socialize and much more.
            </p>
            <p>
            However, our gift made us sophisticated; we advanced beyond the sphere of primal animal life.
            From our instinct to socialize, we constructed societies and civilizations. From our instinct to procreate, 
            we developed social constructs, rules, and countless different methods of engagement. From our need to suppress hunger, 
            we developed rich cuisines. We may use tools and invent technologies to aid us in satisfying our basic instincts, 
            but those drives, in their essence, are not unique to us;
            using advanced technologies and tools does not add a feature or alter their very essence.
            </p>
            <h3>Man and Play</h3>
            <p>
            An instinct that is not unique to us is Play; all mammals play. 
            Play is older than culture for culture presupposes human society. 
            Play is not a recreational activity that children engage in for fun or enjoyment; 
            that is such a shallow, and hence, false description of play; not different from describing 
            sex as an activity that adults engage in for orgasm, or Eating as an activity that rich people 
            engage in for pleasure.  Our brains' reward system enforces certain behaviours that are essential to our survival;
            there’s pleasure in consuming water, in satisfying hunger, in having sex, in socializing. There’s a great feeling of 
            satisfaction and a sense of accomplishment that mothers experience while taking care of their children.ᴿ¹ Science is 
            still investigating the biological basis behind maternal caregiving as it is still not well understood; I claim that this is an 
            instinct that has a significant function beyond the scientific method, perhaps beyond our understanding. So far, we know that this 
            behaviour is encoded deep in every living mammal; it is part of
            life, for, without it, species won't survive or prosper.
            </p>
            <p>
            Play is
            another instinct that has a significant function that we cannot find
            a biological basis to justify.
            There’s “fun“ and “enjoyment” from play because it is an integral part of life. If we play for fun, then we drink water for 
            pleasure. Please, do not content yourself with such shallow conclusions.
            </p>

            <h3>Why Do We Play</h3>
            <p>
            The historian Johan Huizinga has asserted that human civilization added no essential
            feature to the general idea of play, animals of all kinds did not wait for man to teach them their playing.
            Dinosaurs roamed the earth millions of years before our ancestors, and yet, they seemed to have played. 
            Furthermore, Play is not derived from a purely biological or a physical need; it is not a physiological 
            phenomenon or a psychological reflex, even in its purest form, it is
            more. Many psychologists and scientists 
            hypothesized biological functions that play serves; there were numerous attempts to discover 
            such function, some of which include:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Play is a result of a need for <i>relaxation</i>.</li>
                <li>Play is a discharge of an abundant vital energy.</li>
                <li>Play is a method that trains young animals for serious life situation</li>
                <li>Play is a “wish-fulfillment” activity.</li>
                <li>Play is an activity that satisfies the natural need for dominance and competition in a non-harmful environment</li>
            </ul>
            <p>All of these hypotheses share four common flaws:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>They are narrow.</li>
                <li>They start with the assumption that play must serve one particular biological function.</li>
                <li>Play is considered without its profoundly aesthetic
                    properties.</li>
                <li>Play is thought of as a rational activity.</p></li>

            </ul> 
            <p>
            One can effortlessly deduce that all of these hypotheses vary; 
            one hypothesis explains a given instance of play, but fail to
            justify another; rendering its postulated nature to remain as such.
            If we continue to think of play without its essential properties or start with an invalid assumption,
            we continue to stay in the dark. 
            Finally, one cannot assume that Play is a rational activity; for
            otherwise, only humans Played. It extends beyond the sphere of human
            life, and thus, its foundation cannot be discovered in a rational
            nexus.
            </p>
            <p>
            Animals are not merely mechanical; so they play.
            Man is not rational; for Play is irrational.
            It is easier to accept one of these hypotheses; however, one must content themselves with a limited, and a partial answer. 
            I am not worried and neither should you, for contentment has never been and won't be a long-lasting state for man.
            According to Johan Huizinga, a theory that describes the function of
            play must render all the previous hypotheses obsolete, or unify them
            as a coherent whole.
            </p>
            <p>
            I can assure you the following my dear reader: Everyone you know plays in one way or form, 
            despite their age, despite their seriousness.
            It’s challenging to define play, but it’s not difficult to differentiate it from what it’s not:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Play is not the opposite of seriousness, consider
                    soccer.</li>
                <li>Play is not for children, consider gambling.</li>
                <li>Play is not rudimentary, senseless, artificial, pretentious
                    or man-made.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>We are <i>Homo</i> Ludens</h3>
            <p>
            During the 18th century, the age of Enlightenment and ignition of 
            Anti-clericalism took place; blinded by the great advances of the 16th and 17th in science 
            and human thought, many foolishly started to worship reason. We
            boldly, or perhaps naively, decided to 
            name our species <i>Homo. sapiens</i>, Man the Rational.
            Thinkers refuted Sapiens as a name for our species, for we are not worthy of it.
            </p>
            <p>
            The complex nature of our brains gave us the ability to reason; this ability, however, is not in our essence. 
            Any period in recorded human history shows irrationality more than rationality, those who observed and reasoned 
            were the outliers. Even today, irrationality surrounds us, 
            I would encourge you to read some of Sigmund Freud works on the
            unconscious mind, just don't dwell too deep in it.
            </p>
            <p>
            We inclined to designate our species as <i>Homo Faber</i>, Man the
            Maker. Although; not as misleading as Sapiens, it is certainly not
            an appropriate name for our kind human, for man is a ruthless
            destroyer as well. Furthermore, the use of Homo Faber shows "the alienation from and objectification of nature." 
            as the Italian philosopher Umberto Eco argued.
            Johan Huizinga suggested <i>Homo ludens</i>, Man, the Player.
            Linguistically, the latin word Ludens is more involved than "play,"
            it may refer to School, Practice and Sports.
            </p>
            <h3>Other names for Homo Sapiens</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><b><i>Homo adorans</i></b>, Man the Worshiper: too narrow</li>
                <li><b><i>Homo amans</i></b>, Man the Lover: too narrow</li>
                <li><b><i>Homo combinans</i></b>, The Combining Man: We counted
                passed inifinity.</li>
                <li><b><i>Homo avers</i></b>, Man the Greedy: Sadistic</li>
