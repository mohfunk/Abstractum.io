        <h1>Play</h1>
        <div class="text">
            <p>I have always been frustrated with how Play is naively defined; for
            instance, this is how Google Defines it: </p>
            <p></p>
            <p class="cen"><q><i>noun</i>: play. activity engaged in for enjoyment and recreation, especially by
                children.</q></p>
            <p>play, in all its forms, is essential to us. Mammals and other animals seem to engage 
            in play for no clear reason; even dinosaurs, the deadly, cold-blooded reptiles, 
            had a playful side!ᴬ⁰ Play comes in various forms; every kind of sport is a Play 
            activity, every kind of game, puzzle, and toy are forms of play. In this article, 
            I will not explore a particular medium; I will discuss Play in
            general.</p>
            <p>
            I think of Play as a set that contains every playful 
            activity; a set, in mathematics,
            is a well-defined group of different 
            mathematical objects; we define a set so we can think of it as a single object.
            </p>
            <p>
            The set of play is composed of smaller subsets that share more properties in common. For example, 
            the set of Games belongs to the set of Play, Video games are a subset of Games, 
            the set of First-Person Shooters belong to the set of Video Games, 
            and Doom (1993 video game) belongs to the set of First-Person Shooters. 
            Using the transitive property of set inclusion, we can conclude that Doom 
            belongs to play. If you are convinced that Play is important, then Video Games must be 
            important as well, because they're, at this time and age, the most popular form of play; 
            I claim that they are the best form of Play as well, but that is a mere opinion.
            </p>
            <p>
            Many of the ideas, philosophies, and facts mentioned here are not purely mine. I merely adopted them as an appreciator of play,
            and as a student of its craft. This school of thought was established and developed by the Dutch thinker and historian JohanHuizinga 
            in his book Homo Ludens. I will reference any facts I borrowed from his book with "ᴮ⁰".
            </p>
            <h3>Man And Animal</h3>
            <p>
            We tend to believe that we are an exceptional kind of species; divine and different from other animals. 
            We are the only members of the genus homo left on this planet; we are, without a doubt, the most powerful 
            creatures on earth. However, all the evidence available to us seem to suggest that we are the outcome of the long process 
            of Evolution. One may wonder:  if we are not so special, then what is the reason behind our dominance? We are gifted a brain 
            capable of recognizing complex patterns, a curious brain capable of reasoning and thinking abstractly. We are exploring the 
            Cosmos and counting past infinity; however, this dominance in intelligence is newly acquired.
            </p>
            <p>
            1.5 million years ago, humans (members of the genus homo) were insignificant mammals with large skulls; giving birth was 
            difficult since the female birth canal is not wide enough to fit a developed human brain through it. Thus, human babies 
            were born underdeveloped, completely helpless and dependent on their parents.[ref] Females had to spend more time taking 
            care of their infants, and males had to support them, which made our species more social and perhaps it's how we developed
            our most powerful weapon: Language. With our new social skills, we were no longer insignificant. Hence, we were able to find 
            more food to meet the demands of our large brains.[ref] Intelligence is not a property of humans; it's an ability that we acquired 
            through millions of years of evolution with the help of luck, nature, the universe, or God, choose what suits you best.
            </p>
            <p>
            We still share many instincts with other mammals: We procreate in a similar (if not identical) fashion; we feed, protect, and care 
            for our young with the same passion and aggressiveness; we hunt, build homes to take shelter, communicate, socialize and much more.
            </p>
            <p>
            However, our gift made us more sophisticated; we went beyond the sphere of primal animal life. From our instinct to socialize, we 
            constructed societies and civilizations. From our instinct to procreate, we developed social constructs, rules, and many different 
            methods of engagement. From our need to suppress our hunger, we developed rich cuisines. We may use tools and invent technologies 
            to aid us in following our basic instincts, but those drives, in their essence, are not unique to us; using advanced technologies 
            and tools does not add a feature or alter their very essence.
            </p>
            <h3>Man and Play</h3>
            <p>

            An instinct that is not unique to us is Play; all mammals play.ᴮ¹ In fact, Play is older than culture for culture 
            presupposes human society.ᴮ⁰ Play is not a recreational activity that children engage in for fun or enjoyment; 
            that is such a shallow, and hence, a false description of play; not different from describing sex as an activity that 
            adults engage in for orgasm, or Eating as an activity that rich people engage in for pleasure.  Our brains' reward system 
            enforces certain behaviors that are essential to our survival; there’s pleasure in consuming water, in satisfying hunger, 
            in having sex, in socializing. There’s a great feeling of satisfaction and a sense of accomplishment that mothers experience 
            while taking care of their children.ᴿ¹ Science is still investigating the biological basis behind maternal caregiving as it 
            is still not well understood;ᴿ² I claim that this is an instinct that has a significant function beyond the scientific method, 
            perhaps beyond our understanding. So far, we know that this behavior is encoded deep in every living mammal; it is part of life, 
            for without it, species will not survive or prosper.ᴿ³

            Play is another instinct that has a significant function that we simply cannot find a biological basis for. (more on that soon),  
            There’s “fun“ and “enjoyment” from play because it is an important part of life. If we play for fun, then we drink water for pleasure. 
            Please, do not content yourself with such shallow conclusions.
            </p>

            <h3>Why Do We Play</h3>
            <p>
            The historian Johan Huizinga has asserted that human civilization added no essential
            feature to the general idea of play, animals of all kinds did not wait for man to 
            teach them their playing.ᴮ⁰ Dinosaurs roamed the earth millions of years before our 
            ancestors, and yet, they seemed to have played. Furthermore, Play is not derived from 
            a purely biological or a physical need; it is not a physiological phenomenon or a psychological 
            reflex, even in its simplest form, it is more than that. Many psychologists and scientists 
            hypothesized biological functions that play serves; there were numerous attempts to discover 
            such function,ᴮ⁰ some of which include:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Play is a result of a need for <i>relaxation</i>.</li>
                <li>Play is a discharge of an abundant vital energy.</li>
                <li>Play is a method that trains young animals for serious life situation</li>
                <li>Play is a “wish-fulfillment” activity.</li>
                <li>Play is an activity that satisfies the natural need for dominance and competition in a non-harmful environment</li>
            </ul>
            <p>All of these hypotheses share four common flaws:

            They are narrow.
            They start with the assumption that play must serve one particular biological function.ᴮ⁰
            Play is considered without its profoundly aesthetic properties.ᴮ⁰
            Play is thought of as a rational activity.ᴮ⁰</p>
            <p>
            One can effortlessly deduce that all of these hypotheses vary widely; 
            one theory could apply in a given instance of play, but fail to justify another; 
            causing all these beliefs to remain as such. Regarding the 2nd & the 3rd flaw; play would 
            have been encoded in us and other animals in a purely mechanical, and a flat form.ᴮ⁰ Therefore,  
            if we continue to think of play without its essential properties, or start with an invalid assumption,  
            we will only continue to stay in the dark. Finally, if Play is a rational activity then it would have 
            been exclusive to us human beings, but play extends beyond the sphere of human life, and thus its 
            foundation will never be discovered in a rational nexus.ᴮ⁰
            </p>
            <p>
            Animals play, so they must be more than merely mechanical beings.We do play; we know that we play and we adore it, so we must be more than merely rational beings, for play is irrational.ᴮ⁰

            It would be much easier for us to just accept one of these hypotheses and we wouldn't be wrong; however, we would content ourselves with a limited, and a partial answer to the question. I am not worried and neither should you for contentment has never been and will never be a long lasting state for man to be in

            Johan Huizinga believed that If there exists a theory that describes the function that play serves, it must achieve one of these outcomes:ᴮ⁰

            Render all the previous hypotheses obsolete
            Unify them as a coherent whole.
            I can assure you the following my dear reader: Everyone you know plays in one way or form, despite their age, despite their seriousness, Etc... It’s difficult to define play, but it’s not difficult to differentiate it from what it’s not:

            Play is not the opposite of seriousness, consider games like soccer.
            Play is not for children, consider gambling.
            Play is not rudimentary, senseless, artificial, pretentious or man-made.
            </p>
            <h3>We are <i>Homo</i> Ludens</h3>
            <p>
            During the 18th century, the age of Enlightenment and ignition of 
            Anti-clericalism took place; blinded by the great advances of the 16th and 17th in science 
            and human thought, many foolishly started to worship reason.ᵂ³ We boldly or perhaps naively decided to 
            call ourselves Homosapiens, which means Man the Reasonable, indicating that we are all-wise and all-rational. 
            It didn't take thinkers long to refute sapiens as a name for our species, for we are not worthy of it.
            </p>
            <p>
            The complex nature of our brains gave us the ability to reason; this ability, however, is not in our essence. We still act irrationally, not only as individuals but as whole nations. If we examine any period in recorded human history, we can see that there was more irrationality than there was rationality, those who observed and reasoned in the past were the outliers. Even today, irrationality surrounds us, from racism to terrorism and extremism, there is absolutely no rational basis behind such ideologies, and unfortunately, millions if not billions of us would kill and die for them. The 20th-century neurologist Sigmund Freud further suggested that the unconscious mind plays a significant part in our thinking process. I have no ground to assert his theories, but I believe that they popularized the unconscious mind. We are able to reason, but we are not reasonable.
            </p>
            <p>
            We inclined to designate our species as Homo Faber as in: Man the Maker (those who decide their own faith using the tools they make.) Although; not as misleading as Sapiens, it is certainly not appropriate as an accurate name for the human being, consider the following reasons:

            While Man is a maker; Man is a ruthless destroyer as well.
            Claiming that we "decide" our fate is also naively ambitious and optimistic.
            Nevertheless, if we "decide" our destiny, the tools we make are only one factor among many.
            If we were able to survive with no fur to cover us in the cold, no weapons to protect us from man eating beasts, then we wouldn't have been obligated to "make" tools. Thus, the use of Homo Faber represents "the alienation from and objectification of nature." as the Italian philosopher Umberto Eco argued.
            Johan Huizinga suggested Homoludens, as in "Man, the Player." while it may suffer from being too broad as other animals play as well, when we stop being Ludens, we cease to be human. Linguistically, the latin word Ludens is lot more involved than "play" it has no exact english equivalent in english since it has other meanings than play, some of those include School, Practice and Sports.

            Nevertheless, we are not all reasonable and so we are not all Sapiens. We are not all makers of tools, and so we are not all Faber; on the other hand, even if we assume for the sake of the argument that some of us never play, they will be a lot fewer than those who are irrational, and those who never create.
