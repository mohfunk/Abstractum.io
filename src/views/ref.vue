            As a child, I dreamt of a world-leading Saudi Arabia that kept me optimistic when all around me pointed to our incompetence. 
            I assured myself: "when I grow up, I will rebuild my country." I genuinely wanted my people to flourish. We only had Wahhabi 
            clerks to idolize, those failed to speak to me; in fact, they only preached of death, fire, and torture. As a child, I pictured 
            snakes wrapped around my dead body beneath the dirt in my grave. That was not exclusive to me, millions of Saudis lived it, but 
            I decided I deserve better. Indeed, I Left Saudi to study in Canada; nevertheless, I belong to my people, and to them I had every 
            intention to return.

            I rarely followed news; and I never had any politcal views or ideologies, 
            until I heared about the young prince who spoke of my childhood dreams, I designed a 
            "Neo Jeddah" in highschool, and he is building Neom. Surely, here, a leader to believe in. 
            This very prince, criticized Wahhabism in a clear language, seperating it from Islam. That was a godsend, 
            I wanted to be part of this.. not for too long, I regret.
