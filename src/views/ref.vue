            As a child, I dreamt of a world-leading Saudi Arabia, one that kept me optimistic when all around me pointed to our incompetence. I assured myself: "when I grow up, I will rebuild my country." I genuinely wanted my people to flourish. We only had Wahhabi clerks to idolize, those failed to speak to me; in fact, they preached of death, fire, and torture. As a child, I pictured snakes wrapped around my dead body beneath the dirt of my grave. That was not exclusive to me, millions of Saudis lived it. I, however, decided to leave and Indeed, I Left Saudi to study in Canada. Nevertheless, I belong to my people, and to them, I had every intention to return.

            I rarely followed news; and I never had any political views or ideologies to subscribe to, until I heard about the young prince who spoke of my childhood dreams, I designed a "Neo Jeddah" in high school, and he is building Neom. Surely, here, a leader to believe in. This very prince, criticized Wahhabism in a clear language, separating it from Islam. It was a godsend; I aspired to contribute to his reforms, not for long, I regret.

            The foreign minister of Canada tweeted to destroy me; I wouldn't have imagined how a tweet could undo the last four years of my life. I was furious, and I clearly expressed that; only to see that
            I was not allowed to show anything but complete obedience to my king, and admiration for my wise crown prince. I frankly was too concerned about my future to follow orders blindly, but how can I be assured when my father turned against me? When my friends are bothered by me? Instead of reassuring me, my people refused to talk to me, some attacked me, and many criminalized me!

            I was deeply bothered to find myself dragged into politics, so I turned to the media, I saw ignorance and false claims about people I
            loved. The Saudi Media was too busy lying about Canada while praising the wisdom and might of the crown prince. I was looking for a voice to remind me of the welcoming warmth of my people, to find one among many that terrorized me. A Saudi "Vlogger" promised students severe punishment if they complain or disobey. The prince will kidnap, torture and silence you like he did with many before.
            I felt dehumanized, and I genuinely feared my country.

            I eventually found the warmth of my people, not in those residing in it, but in those dissented from it. May they rest in peace. I weep for those who take the Quran as their constitution, then corrupt while claiming to be reformers; they failed to read the second page of their "constitution."
